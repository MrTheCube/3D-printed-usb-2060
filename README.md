So basically, I am sort of a tech nerd and I found that the newer FE (fan edition) cards from nvidia are really good looking.
I wanted to buy one but the prices seems to go up a little lol, so I asked my self : "what would be the best way to get 
sort of a functionnal one, that does not cost 800 bucks and I can plug in my laptop". The answer was very clear : let's make a usb
stick shell that looks like an RTX 3060. I did spend a small 4 to 5 houres in this projects, more than 3 prototypes (I've added the 
fans later in the 2nd prototype because i did not knew how to make them small and robust) and a day do figure how to take the stupid 
supports of lol.
